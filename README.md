# Updated-Portfolio3
This is the third iteration of my personal website. This is similar to the second iteration's design however, I have added more animations.

I designed it using the following technologies:

* CSS(3) & HTML
* Javascript
* Bootstrap(Minimal Usage)

## Animations

This was added at the head.
```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.css" />
```

Add script right before closing </body> tag, and initialize AOS:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.js"></script>
<script>
    AOS.init();
</script>
 ```
